--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

### Install and launch application

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
Run `java -version` on your command terminal to check your Java version.

2. Download the latest `TeamTracker.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TeamTracker.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the
`java -jar TeamTracker.jar`command to run the application (if you are not sure how to use the command terminal,
refer to [this](#if-you-have-no-experience-on-command-terminal-open-and-navigate-the-command-terminal) 
section for a more detailed guide).<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should be displayed in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png =500x400)

5. Congratulations, you are now a TeamTracker user! Get ready to take control of your tasks and contacts efficiently!<br>
You can begin with the [Basic tutorial](#basic-tutorial-for-starters) section or refer to the [Features](#features) 
section if you already had prior experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### (If you have no experience on command terminal) Open and navigate the command terminal

1. Search for "Terminal", open the first app that popped up.
A UI similar to the below should appear.<br>

Now you should be at the folder where `TeamTracker.jar` is stored.
4. Type `java -jar TeamTracker.jar` then Enter to run the application and the app User Interface should be displayed.<br>

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png =500x400)

If not, you might run `java -version` to check the Java version of your computer before running the jar file. 
Read the [Quick start](#quick-start) section again to check the Java version required for our app.
5. Congratulations, you are now a TeamTracker user! Get ready to take control of your tasks and contacts efficiently!<br>
   You can begin with the [Basic tutorial](#basic-tutorial-for-starters) section or refer to the [Features](#features) section
   if you already had prior experience.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Basic tutorial (for starters)

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the basics of using our app to manage your tasks efficiently. With 
TeamTracker, staying organized has never been easier. Let's get started!

The image below is the application interface with more detailed annotations for you to gain a better understanding
of each part in our app. <br>

![UI_annotated](images/UI_annotated.png =500x400)

You can see that the UI is divided into four main parts:

* Command Box: This is where you enter your command into the app.
* Message Box: After you entered a command, the message showing the result of a command will be shown here.
* Person List: Displays the list of people stored in your app.
  * Each person has a **name** that is displayed beside their number on the list. As names are the most natural way for you 
to distinct between people, we made it the most notable part for person so that you can look at different people with ease.
  * Under the name are other personal information of a person. From top to bottom, they are **phone number, address and email**.
These additional information are used when you need to contact a friend or group mate about any issues you might have.
  * Additional information that will be shown later is the **tasks assigned to a person**. When a task is assigned
to a person, that task will be displayed as a block under the person's name. In this image, there are no tasks assigned
to any person.
* Task List: Displays the list of tasks stored in your app.
  * Each task has a **task name** beside their number on the list. Similar to person, names are the best way for you
to distinct between tasks, so we choose it to be the most notable part in each task.
  * Beside task name is another essential aspect for managing tasks, which is **task status**. A task can either be
<span style="color:green">Done</span> or <span style="color:red">Not Done</span>. Therefore, when you look at tasks, 
you would prioritize tasks that are unfinished before those that are done already. 
  * Under the task name is task priority, which can be <span style="color:green">Low</span>, <span style="color:yellow">Medium</span>,
or <span style="color:red">High</span>. This also determines how important a task is so you can choose which one to finish first.
  * Under the task priority is task description, which contains the details of a task that task name did not cover.
  * Another additional information that was left out in this part is task deadline. Deadline contains a date and time and
it tells you when a task is due so that you can plan accordingly.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Now, let's try to add a task into our task list. Type `addtask n/MA HW d/math homework 4 week 12 p/high` into the 
command box and press Enter. The result should be similar to this: <br>

![UI_addtask](images/UI_addtask.png =500x400)

After you finish a task, you can mark that task as done. From the image above, you can see that the task "MA HW" is at
number 1 on the list. Therefore, to mark that task as done, type `marktask 1` and this should be your result: <br>

![UI_marktask](images/UI_marktask.png =500x400)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here you might ask "Why is the task MA HW moved to number 3?". That is because we want you to see the tasks that you
have not finished first when you look at the list. More details are given in the 
[Notes about tasks order](#notes-about-tasks-order) section.

After you have finished the task "MA HW", you might no longer need to store that task in the app. 
In that case, type `deletetask 3` since the task is now at position number 3 on the list. And this is what 
you should see: <br>

![UI_deletetask](images/UI_deletetask.png =500x400)

Congratulations! You have learned how to add, mark, and delete tasks using TeamTracker. With these basic commands,
you can start managing your tasks with ease.

For a comprehensive overview of all the powerful commands at your fingertips, be sure to check out 
the [Features](#features) section to unlock the full potential of TeamTracker.

## Features

### Notes

#### Notes about tasks order

When managing tasks in TeamTracker, it's essential to understand the order in which tasks are displayed to ensure 
efficient organization:

<box type="info" seamless>

* Tasks are first sorted based on their status, with those marked as "not done" appearing before
those marked as "done." This prioritization allows users to focus on pending tasks before reviewing completed ones, 
facilitating better task management.
* Within each status category, tasks are sorted based on their priority level. Tasks with a high priority are 
displayed first, followed by those with a medium priority, and finally, tasks with a low priority. This hierarchy ensures that urgent tasks are prominently featured, allowing users to address critical matters promptly.
* In the event of a tie in priority level, tasks are further sorted by their deadline. Tasks with a closer deadline are
displayed before later deadline. This is another factor for you to decide which task should be handled immediately.
* If all other factors result in a tie, tasks are further sorted lexicographically, based on their names 
then descriptions. This ensures a consistent and predictable order for tasks with the same priority, 
enabling users to easily locate specific tasks within their lists.

</box>

#### Notes about reading command guide

Each command in this guide are formatted with the following conventions:

<box type="info" seamless>

* Description: This part tells you what the function of each command is.
* Format: How you should input each command into the app.
* Tips/Notes (if there is any): This part contains further details for the input of each command.
* Result: How the app will behave based on what input you give for each command.

</box>

#### Notes about the command format

<box type="info" seamless>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Shi Kang`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/TASK_NAME [by/DEADLINE]` can be used as `n/Task 1 by/23-12-2024 23:59` or as `n/Task 1`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such 
as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* These commands currently support mass operations, which means they can be applied on multiple inputs in one command,
as long as you specified all inputs:
  * delete
  * assign
  * unassign
  * marktask
  * unmarktask
  * deletetask

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span 
multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Managing Person

#### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the person list.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESSâ€‹`

</box>

Result:
* If all input you provided is valid, that person will be added to the person list with their respective personal
information.
* If any of the input (names, phone numbers, emails, address) you provided is invalid, the respective error message for that
invalid input will appear, so that you know how to change your input accordingly,
* If any of the input (names, phone numbers, emails, address) is missing, the invalid command format message will be shown,
along with the correct format for the command.

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567`

Edits an existing person in the list.

Format: `edit PERSON_INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS]`

Notes:
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, â€¦â€‹
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values for that respective field.

Result:
* If no fields are provided, an error message will be displayed.
* Otherwise, the app replaces the value in the field you specified with the value you provided.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Notes:
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Result:
* If no matching name is found, an empty list is displayed
* If the search find at least one person, all person found will be displayed as a list and they are sorted by
their names lexicographically.

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`

  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult_v1.4.png =500x400)

#### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified persons from the address book.

Format: `delete PERSON_INDEX [MORE_PERSON_INDICES]`

Notes:
* Duplicate indices will be removed, e.g. `delete 1 1` is the same as `delete 1`.
* The order of the indices does not matter, e.g. `delete 1 2` is the same as `delete 2 1`.
* The indices refer to the index numbers shown in the displayed person list.
* The indices **must be positive integers** 1, 2, 3, ...
* If at least one of the indices are invalid, the command fails, e.g. `list` followed by `delete 1 2` fails if there is only one person in the address book.

Result:
* If one of the `INDEX` you provided is not on the displayed list, an error message will be shown. It will tell you the index
you provided is invalid
* Otherwise, the person(s) with the index(or indices) you provide on the displayed person list is/are deleted.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 1 2` deletes the first two persons in the address book.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Managing task

#### Adding a task: `addtask`

* Adds a task to the task list with three levels of priority (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH).
* Priority can also be in integers (1-Low, 2-Medium, 3-High).
* The deadline is optional for the adding of tasks.

Format: `addtask n/TASK_NAME d/TASK_DESCRIPTION p/TASK_PRIORITY [by/TASK_DEADLINE]â€‹`

Notes:
* Task name can be any characters, not just alphanumeric. Same for task description.
* Task priority currently has three values: <span style="color:green">Low</span>, <span style="color:yellow">Medium</span>,
or <span style="color:red">High</span>, and their respective numerical values are 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, for priority,
you can use both low, medium and high or 1, 2, 3 respectively.
* Task deadline must be in the format `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm`.

Result:
* If any of the compulsory input is missing, an error message of invalid command format will appear.
* If task priority are specified with a value different from the {low, medium, high, 1, 2, 3} set, an error message
about task priority will be shown.
* If the deadline is not in the correct DateTime format, an error message about deadline will be displayed.
* Otherwise, if all the inputs are valid, a new task is added to the task list using the information provided.

Examples:
* `addtask n/Task 1 d/Do homework p/HIGH`
* `addtask n/Task 1 d/Do homework p/1`
* `addtask n/Task 1 d/Do homework p/HIGH by/12-12-2024 23:59`

#### Assigning a task: `assign`

Assigns a task to persons.

Format: `assign TASK_INDEX to/PERSON_INDEX [MORE_PERSON_INDICES]`

* The task/person indices refer to the index numbers shown in the displayed task/person list.
* The indices **must be positive integers** 1, 2, 3, ...
* If at least one of the indices are invalid, the command fails, e.g. `list` followed by `assign 1 to/1 2` fails if there is only one person in the address book.
* If a specified person is already assigned the task, the command still succeeds, and no change will occur to the person.

Result:
* If at least one of the index provided is invalid, an error message will be displayed.
* Otherwise, the task assigned will be shown under each assigned person's name.

![UI_assign](images/UI_assign.png =500x400)

Examples:
* `list` and `listtask` followed by `assign 1 to/1 2` assigns the 1st task in the task list to the first two persons in the address book.
* `find Betsy` and `findtask implement` followed by `assign 1 to/1` assigns the 1st task in the results of the `findtask` command to the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

### Others

#### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page (the User Guide).

![help message](images/helpMessage_v1.3a.PNG)

Format: `help`

Result: Display a box that contains the link to the User Guide.

#### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

Result: Close the app.

#### Saving the data

AddressBook and TaskList data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. 
There is no need to save manually.

#### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. 
TaskList data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/tasklist.json`.
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing the data files.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TeamTracker will discard all data and start with an 
empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TeamTracker to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value 
entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are 
confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Future updates

#### Create group `[coming in v2.0]`

The `Create group` command enables users to select a list of unique individuals from their contacts and 
create a group comprising those chosen members.

#### Clear task list `[coming in v2.0]`

This command will be very similar to the `clear` command, but instead of clearing the person list, this command would
clear the task list instead.

#### Undo a command `[coming in v2.0]`

The `Undo` command in TeamTracker offers users the convenience of reverting the most recent action with a 
simple command. Whether an accidental deletion or unintended modification, this feature provides you a quick 
and efficient way to backtrack the last action, restoring the previous state effortlessly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TeamTracker home folder.

**Q**: Why is there no way to delete only the deadline of a task?<br>
**A**: Currently we do not have a command that supports such specific task. However, one alternative to achieve your
desired result is to delete the task you want to remove the deadline, then add that task again with all the old fields
except for deadline. The process is somewhat tedious, but it gives you what you desired.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues
